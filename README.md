![](./Resources/NetsLogo.jpg)

## Getting started

PiA Netaxept iOS SDK is a library that provides the native in-app interactions to accept payments with Netaxept directly from native iOS apps while minimizing PCI DSS requirements for you.

PiA - Netaxept Mobile SDK Android can be found [here](https://github.com/Nets-mobile-acceptance/Netaxept-Android-SDK).

## Sample Project

We have provided a sample project, PiaSample, in the repository which is written in Swift 4 and it demonstrates Pia usage and capabilities. To use it download the repo, run **pod install** to download the required libraries and open **PiaSample.xcworkspace**. Then, delete the libs folder with everything in it and follow one of the installation types from below to add **Pia.framework**, either [manual installation](#manually) steps or [Carthage](#carthage). After that, navigate to **ConstantAPI.swift** to add your Merchant Backend URLs and Netaxept Merchant IDs.

## Project status
Supported payment methods:
* Cards: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Diners, JCB, Dankort
* Apple Pay
* PayPal
* Nordic mobile wallets (Vipps, Swish, MobilePay) â€“ *available soon*

## Requirements
* PiA iOS SDK requires iOS 9 or above.
* Card scanning functionality requires *Camera Permission*, the camera usage must be added to *Info.plist* file in the host application.

```
Key    :  Privacy - Camera Usage Description   
Value  :  $(PRODUCT_NAME) camera us

## Installation
### Carthage
**NOTE: If this is the first time you are using Carthage, please refer to this [guide](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) for correct installation.**

If you do not have Carthage yet, refer to this [link](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for complete instruction from Carthage.

* Make the following entry in your Cartfile:

```
github "Nets-mobile-acceptance/Netaxept-iOS-SDK"
```

* Run `carthage update`.
* Go inside your project's folder in Carthage/Checkouts/Netaxept-iOS-SDK and unzip PiaSDKFramework.zip.
* Go to your project's target General tab and drag the Pia.framework into the Linked Frameworks and Libraries section.
* Add Pia.framework to Embedded Binaries from the General tab.


### Manually
* Download/clone this https://github.com/Nets-mobile-acceptance/Netaxept-iOS-SDK.git
* Unzip **PiaSDKFramework.zip** to obtain **Pia.framework**.
* Drag and drop **Pia.framework** to your project.
* Go to your project target at Build Phases.
* Add Pia.framework to Link Binary With Libraries.
* Add Pia.framework to Embedded Binaries from the General tab.

### NOTE
Because of enabling Bitcode, the framework size exceeds the 100MB limit of GitHub uploading policy.

One option is to use Carthage for automated installation.

Alternatively, if you wish to install the SDK manually, please refer to the following walk-around for uploading to GitHub:
1. Add "Pia.framework" to your **.gitignore** list
2. Use [GitHub large file system](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to continue uploading framework within your working project

## Usage
After setup is ready, using PiA SDK is easy. For full references, please refer to **Documentation** folder.

### Normal Payment Flow - Use this flow for card payments

```swift
let piaSDK = PiaSDKController(merchantInfo: merchantInfo, orderInfo:orderInfo)
piaSDK.piaDelegate = self
self.present(piaSDK, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
### Easy Payment Flow - Use this flow for returning users who previously saved their card information
```swift
let piaSDK = PiaSDKController(merchantInfo, orderInfo: orderInfo, tokenCardInfo: tokenCardInfo)
piaSDK.piaDelegate = self
self.present(piaSDK, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
### ApplePay flow - Use this flow to trigger Apple Pay payments
```swift
let applePayInfo = self.createApplePayInfo(amount: amount, currencyCode: currencyCode, usingExpressCheckout: true)
let piaSDK = PiaSDKController(applePayInfo: applePayInfo)
piaSDK.piaDelegate = self
self.present(piaSDK, animated: true,  completion: nil)
```

### Delegation
```swift
* func piaSDK(_ PiaSDK: PiaSDKController, didFailWithError error: NPIError)

* func piaSDKDidComplete(withSuccess PiaSDK: PiaSDKController)

* func piaSDKDidCompleteSaveCard(withSuccess PiaSDK: PiaSDKController)

* func piaSDKDidCancel(_ PiaSDK: PiaSDKController)
```
**NOTE:** If you wish to support Shipping Address with Apple Pay, remember to conform to this (optional) delegate.

```swift
func piaSDK(_ PiaSDKController: PiaSDKController, didChangeApplePayShippingContact contact: PKContact, withCompletion completionHandler: @escaping (Bool, NSDecimalNumber?) -> Void)
```
